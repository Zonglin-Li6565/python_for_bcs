    6. Write a program that asks for the temperature, and asks if it is in C or F, and converts it to the other 
        and prints it out.

print("Output of question #6")
# your code for #6 goes here
print()

    7. Write a program that will compute the area of a circle. 
    Prompt the user to enter the radius and print a nice message back to the user with the answer.

    8.  It is possible to name the days 0 through 6 where day 0 is Sunday and day 6 is Saturday.
        If you go on a wonderful holiday leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday) and you return home after 10 nights. 
    Write a general version of the program which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, 
    and it will tell you the number of day of the week you will return on.
'''
print("Output of question #8")
# your code for #8 goes here
print()

    9.  write code that reads in file 'test_file2.txt', creates a separate file for each geographic region 
        the animals are from, and prints only the animals from that region to the file, one animal per line.
        for example, you should create the file 'africa.txt', and that file should have:
        
        elephant
        lion
        giraffe
        zebra
        hyena
        
        also, the program cannot "hard code" the names of the files. You need to figure out the names of the output 
        files from the input files. For example, if I test your code on a new input file that has animals from china, or
        antarctica, or Wonderland, the program should still work!

    10. write code that:
        1.) takes 'test_file1.txt' as input
        2.) stores each line in list
        3.) uses a for loop to iterate over that list
        4.) uses a second for loop to iterate over each word in each sentence
        5.) uses a while loop to iterate over each letter in the word, until there are no more letters in the word
        6.) prints out the document, one letter at a time, with each word on a different line and each letter separated
                by a space. For example, the first three lines should be:
                
                T h e
                g r i z z l y
                b e a r
